# Breast Cancer Classification with a Simple Neural Network

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant using a simple neural network. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which is widely recognized in the field of medical data analysis.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Creating an accurate and efficient neural network model for tumor classification.
- Evaluating the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.
- Visualizing the results to facilitate a better understanding of the modelâ€™s effectiveness.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which comprises:
- **Features:** 30 numerical attributes describing tumor characteristics, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.
- **Target Variable:** A label indicating whether the tumor is benign (0) or malignant (1).

## Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology, which includes the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** This involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the feature values to ensure consistent input for the model.
2. **Model Development:** A simple neural network is constructed, comprising input, hidden, and output layers. This architecture allows the model to learn patterns in the data.
3. **Training the Model:** The model is trained using a portion of the dataset while a separate validation set is used to monitor performance and prevent overfitting.
4. **Evaluation:** The model's effectiveness is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with the test dataset.
5. **Visualization:** Graphical representations of the model's performance are created to illustrate the training process and results.

## Results
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage] on the test dataset.
- Visualizations demonstrate the model's training history, including how loss and accuracy evolve over epochs.
